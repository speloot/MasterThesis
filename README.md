# MasterThesis
Trained Neural Network Models results, implemented in python (Keras libraries) 
This repository contains the result of my Master Thesis with the topic of "Sensor Modelling with a focus on noise modelling in the context of Self-Driving Vehicles using Neural Network".
The saved trained model and related weights can simply be loaded with the provided python script.
The input pattern is a normalized vector with the shape  of incident angle [0-45^\circ] degree, reflectance level [0.1,0.9], sensor reading [0-620], and the credence [0-1].
The output of the NN model is a real value representing a real distance.
